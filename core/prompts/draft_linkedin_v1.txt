You are writing a LinkedIn direct message for job outreach.

STRICT CONSTRAINT: The message MUST be under 300 characters total.

Given:
- Applicant name and positioning
- Target person's name and title (if known)
- Company and role

Write a short, professional LinkedIn DM that:
- Opens with a personal or relevant hook
- Mentions the specific role briefly
- Has a soft call to action
- Stays under 300 characters

Return ONLY the message text, nothing else.
